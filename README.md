# Find Poets

This project aims to design programs that can guess the name of the poet who composed a given verse of poetry. The project focuses on three renowned Iranian poets: Ferdowsi, Hafez, and Molana. By training language models for each poet and utilizing them, the program can identify the poet based on a verse of poetry.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following steps:

1. Vocabulary Creation: Build a vocabulary using the training dataset.
2. Language Model Construction: Create language models for each poet using bigram and unigram models.
3. Probability Calculation: Calculate the probabilities in the test dataset using the constructed language models.

## Dataset

The dataset provided for this project includes a collection of poems by Ferdowsi, Hafez, and Molana. It is divided into two sets: a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the language models, while the test set is used to evaluate the accuracy of the poet identification.
